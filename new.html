              Life is war; Marriage is work too!
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              The fighting started from the womb, even before we were conceived,
              millions of sperms were released for fertilization, the sperm that
              fought and won got ahead of others to fertilize one egg. After
              fertilization the fight for survival continued, we fought to get
              our needs met, even before our mothers got her own needs met -
              that is the needed fight for survival in the womb for a viable
              growth to term, and successful delivery into the world. <br />
              As soon as the baby is born, the fight continues for survival -
              oxygen, warmth, nourishment, comfort etc, which every baby must
              have. Without these the only way the baby could continue the fight
              is to cry until that baby’s need is met. Both the baby and the
              mother must continue to fight until the baby becomes a toddler. We
              hear of the toddler crying when they are confronted with real or
              imaginary discomfort or danger until he or she begins to recognize
              the challenges of life, and knows how to respond appropriately and
              continues the fight for survival all through life. <br />
              <br />

              Life is ‘work’ as we continue the fight. It is inevitable that we
              have to fight for anything that is worthwhile; anything that will
              help us make progress in life requires some efforts. That is why
              we must study endless hours in the areas of our secular calling to
              succeed and graduate in through various schools, and later
              practice in our different careers. After we graduate, we still
              have to keep abreast and study to remain current; some of us have
              to struggle and attend classes to renew our certifications, and
              maintain our licenses of practice to be more effective, efficient,
              and eligible to keep us in the profession. <br />
              <br />

              However, when it comes to our marriage, we feel we have married
              'the will of God in marriage’, ‘our soul mates’ or ‘high
              school/college sweethearts’, ‘beautiful sister, anointed brother’,
              ‘upwardly mobile’ etc, and that we have arrived and expect things
              to work automatically, smoothly, peacefully without any effort or
              fight for our marriage to survive and succeed. This is a fantasy
              and deception that leads to disappointments, and ought not to be.
              <br />
              <br />

              As people of God operating on God’s principles in his Kingdom on
              Earth, we have been notified in Ephesians 6:12-13, that we are in
              a warfare – ‘Life is war’. Our understanding of what type of fight
              we are in, is vital to our winning that fight. <br /><br />

              The bible says my people perish for lack of knowledge (Hosea
              4:6)..The bible enlightens us in Ephesians chapter six who we are
              fighting. First it made it clear that our fight is not against
              flesh and blood, so it is not a physical fight against our
              spouses, in laws or any other human being. So, who are we
              fighting? In verse twelve it implies that our fight is against
              unseen forces that control what we see. <br />
              Fighting what we see will be fighting amiss, as Paul says " I do
              not fight aimlessly as one beating the air( 1 Cor. 9:26). <br />
              <br />

              To every human, there is an allocated daily amount of emotional
              energy, hence application of this targeted in the right direction
              will accumulate into our efficiency and success in winning this
              unavoidable fight. <br />
              <br />

              There is therefore the need for us to be intentional in applying
              the intelligence that we get about the nature of the war and
              strategies for the fight. We need to set our priorities right and
              in the right direction to properly and efficiently use our
              emotional energy. <br />
              <br />

              How do we fight these unseen forces that are behind what we see,
              and are causing these problems that we face in our marriages?
              <br />
              In Ephesians 6;13-17, the bible lists the weapons of our warfare
              that are not fleshly but mighty through God, to pull down every
              stronghold (ancestral/generational/mental/emotional). <br />
              In verse 14, we learn about ‘the Breastplate of righteousness’ -
              that is one of the defensive weapon, to protect our hearts, as the
              bible says we should guard our hearts with all diligence (Prov.
              4:23). Righteousness (an ability to do what is right always) has
              been given to us as a gift from God through Salvation, however as
              the bible says we should work out our Salvation with trembling and
              fear, even though we have received the gift of Salvation but we
              are still encouraged to work it out. The bible says God is not
              unrighteous to forget your labor of love ( Heb. 6:10), so to
              forget the good your spouse or someone did to you and concentrate
              on their shortcomings will be deemed as an unrighteous acts that
              will not reflect the fruits of your righteousness, and strengthen
              your defenses in this battle. <br />
              Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him
              it is sin- James 4:17. Marriage for the most part is all about
              being selfless and meeting each others need, not taking time to
              understand and meet your partner's needs in the marital
              relationship is considered not doing right, and a sin that will
              weaken this weapon of your defense. <br />
              <br />

              Another weapon which is offensive in nature mentioned is the
              ‘sword of the Spirit’, which is the word of God. Do you take time
              to find out what God says about the issues you are facing in your
              marriage? Have you taken time out with your partner to take these
              words to another level of confession, turning them into prayers?
              It will work as a sword in the Spirit to accomplish its purpose
              and bring a resolution to the situations you are dealing with.
              Have you taken the words to God in prayers to remind God of his
              promises concerning your marriage? <br />
              <br />

              The last offensive weapon that is very crucial to note is the
              ‘shield of Faith’. It takes faith which brings courage to stay in
              a marriage and confront the odds. As we know we are all ‘work in
              progress’, and the fight of what is in it for me, or getting my
              needs met first are most of the fights we deal with in our
              marriages. Even then, still we are encouraged not to fight this
              battle in a carnal way. Our weapon of Faith says we will be able
              to quench every darts (that manifests in selfishness in our
              marriages). <br />
              We need faith for courage to be able to love our spouses no matter
              what; to be able to tolerate any misbehavior until God touches
              their hearts for a change. <br />
              As we may know, we don't have the power to change anyone, it is
              the job of the Holy Spirit, hence you need faith to patiently wait
              for the Holy Spirit to perfect the works in your partner. As you
              embark on this Faith journey, God is working in you too, as you
              draw strength from him. <br />
              Sometimes you might need to seek help/counseling when you are in a
              violent or unbearable abusive marital situations. <br />
              <br />

              Marriage is a place of an opportunity for spiritual growth, and as
              you grow through all these, and in growing together you will see
              your desires being met because you fight the right way. <br />
              <br />

              The application of this wisdom of God in your marital battles will
              produce the fruits of peace and marital bliss you desire in your
              marriages. <br />
              Picking your battles with wisdom and fighting the right way,
              enables you to be more productive and fruitful. It produces a
              positive attitude that helps to confront other challenges of life.
              <br />
              <br />

              When you fight this battle in the flesh, you often end up in
              arguments, fights, resentments, bitterness and frustrations that
              do not bring about any improvement but rather make the battles
              worse very often. <br />
              We ought to turn the issues in our marriages to prayer points.
              <br />
              Fighting and fighting properly are very beneficial. <br />
              <br />

              In 1Corinthian 2:9 the Bible assures us that ‘…Eye hath not seen,
              nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
              things which God hath prepared for them that love him.’ <br />
              It takes loving God to fight and go with his recommendations on
              his ways to fight. <br />
              Surrounding yourself with people of like passion is helpful in
              providing the needed encouragement to fight the right way. <br />
              May God empower us always to be engaged in our marital fights, and
              in the right way for a successful outcome in Jesus name 🙏 <br />
              <br />

              Shalom! <br />
