              Embracing the Various Seasons of Marriage
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              ‘I will go before you and make the crooked places straight…’
              (Isaiah 45:2). <br />
              Marriage is the only institution you often go into without any
              formal training, and you are also awarded the ‘marriage
              certificate’ before taking the necessary courses. <br />
              Looking at that initial verse quoted on the day of your marriage
              can be very encouraging to provide confidence to go through the
              wedding vows without thinking much about what lies ahead. While
              the word of God is true and the scripture can not be broken, we
              know there is some work to be done. A pragmatic interpretation of
              that scripture may be that ‘you have all that is needed to address
              any unexpected events along the way’. So, there is some work to
              do. <br /> <br>

              Someone said, ‘marriage is like a garden’. The way it looks is how
              much work you put into it. Our marriages will go through different
              seasons, and each season requires a different approach in managing
              it. <br> Just like the flower garden, you know watching is very
              important to realize that one season has ended, and another season
              is rolling in, and that has a lot to do with adequate preparation.
              During the wintertime, you protect the flowers from the frost
              bite, which will not be the time to apply fertilizers, etc. In the
              same way, we need to study our marriage to know what seasons they
              are in. <br />
              The cycle repeats itself so many times in our marriages,
              constantly moving from season to season, according to marriage
              experts. <br /> <br>

              <b>The different seasons and what to expect: </b><br /> <br>

              Winter/fall season: Winter season in marriages is characterized by
              coldness, harshness, and bitterness, just like what is experienced
              during that season. <br />
              Every marriage faces difficulties, and all couples have
              differences. The main problem arises when couples fail to realize
              and negotiate these differences. That's why couples find
              themselves in the middle of winter — a season of marriage created
              not only by the difficulties of life but by the manner of response
              of the couple to those difficulties. <br />
              When we are watchful and sensitive to this, it's not the time to
              throw in the towel. It should be a time to see it as a wake-up
              call for growth on both sides. <br /> <br>

              Some couples have broken up into divorce during this season
              because of ignorance. They say, "we are just not compatible
              anymore." They then part ways, but the need for both to grow
              spiritually will still be there. <br> Rather than grow together, they
              part ways to grow apart. Growth is not easy because it often
              requires some changes, which can be difficult for a lot of people.
              This is the time for both to get on their knees and cry to God,
              the third person in their union. <br />
              They should seek his face and ask for grace and more grace to pass
              through this season, and for God to help them navigate through the
              season as they both grow through it. <br /> <br>

              During one winter season my husband and I went through, it seemed
              we just couldn't agree on anything, and the devil likes that
              because like the bible says ‘Can two walk together except they be
              agreed?" (Amos 3:3). So it's his strategy to cause division and
              hinder the blessings of God that comes from being united" (Ps
              133:1). <br />

              It's not the time to start involving outsiders and opening the
              door of your marriage to intruders. Just as in the time of Adam
              and Eve, there will be snakes and giants in everyone's garden and
              promised land. Not opening the gate for them to come in to
              escalate the season and compound the problems is the key. <br />

              Dealing with thoughts that are not in line with your marital
              covenants is very essential. <br> Negative thoughts about your partner
              will come into the mind, but it should not be entertained. The
              word of God should be used to cast down every imagination that
              does not align with God’s word and plan for your marriage. <br />
              Family members and friends are not also the best to be involved
              because of the tendency of biases. Even when the season has long
              moved to another season, some will still be holding unto things
              the couples have sorted out and moved past. <br />

              They may still be relating with you both as if still in that
              winter season, based on the information they were fed with during
              the winter season. Thank God my husband and I had enough spiritual
              sense during one of those winter seasons to look for a common
              ground that we both agreed on. <br />
              We decided to relate in a way that reinforces our common ground
              and interests. That was very helpful for us. <br /> <br>

              Spring and summer seasons of marriage: Just as the characteristics
              of those seasons, things are blossoming between the couples, this
              mostly start with the honeymoon and some early part of marriage,
              and the slogan "love is blind" can be related to this season. The
              happiness of being newly wed and accomplishments of the success of
              the wedding ceremony and the joy of belonging to each other
              contributes to this season. <br />
              This is a time to build pleasant memories for the fall and winter
              season. The state of the marriage during this season will
              determine the severity of the winter season to a great extent.
              “When you foster the springtime attitudes of optimism, gratitude,
              love, and trust, you will enjoy the fragrant blossoming of spring
              in your marriages. Such attitudes lead to positive actions.” says
              Gary Chapman. <br /> <br>

              A couple experiencing a summer season will have a positive
              attitude about their marriage, and they will be experiencing
              marital bliss, and the need to continue watering the flowers of
              their marital garden is needed to keep the flow of things and also
              to store up good memories for the fall/winter seasons. <br />

              The importance of praying together during this period can not be
              overemphasized as in all seasons of marriage because God, the
              third person in the marital relationship, should be involved in
              everything between the couple. He is the only one that can shed
              light into the needed process of survival in the fall/ winter
              seasons as well as provide guidance into how to grow, build and
              store up good memories during the spring and summer seasons that
              will provide needed courage to keep going on in the relationship
              as he helps to navigate to the next season successfully. <br />

              While we know there's no perfection on Earth, including our
              marriages, we can always strive to make our marriages better in
              order to be the best they can be, and bring much glory to our
              heavenly father. <br />
              Shalom, <br />
