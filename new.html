            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              As we all know marriage is God’s idea revealed in Genesis 2:18,
              “And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be
              alone, I will make him a help meet for him.” <br />
              God was initiating marriage with that statement and saying that He
              will make a help meet for him. <br> When God said it is not good for a
              man to be alone it mathematically suggests that one man with no
              woman equals no good. Which means that one man plus one woman
              equals good, because it not good for a man to be alone. Man with
              woman is what is good, so this is God equations. <br> And if you are
              happily married you have done a good thing and the Bible says “He
              that findeth a wife findeth a good thing.” Similar to when a man
              finds treasures, this is of value and thus, he will want to keep
              and protect it. <br> We are talking about how God understands marriage
              (man with woman plus God is even better). <br> If man plus woman equals
              good, man plus woman plus God must equal better. If we going, we
              now have the man plus the woman plus God plus a Godly home and
              Godly children that equals best. <br> That is the mathematics God gave
              us in Genesis, and thus, this is God’s examples of marriage. When
              man realizes that alone is not good enough and the man decides to
              search for a woman, I believe that most men will definitely come
              across so many beautiful ladies before they make up their minds to
              choose one. <br> Imagine you went to elementary school when you are
              still young, you went to high school, you went to college and then
              you went to work at different places you must have come across so
              many women that love your heart. <br />
              <br />

              But a day came in your life, you decided to search for the one you
              want, because the Bible said it is not good for man to be alone.
              Out of the thousands of women you came across in your life you
              decided to choose your wife, isn’t she blessed? The Bible says,
              the man received favor to find his wife. <br> When we go to a good
              neighborhood and find a good property, we bring good money for it.
              If we just leave it there, after awhile weed will start growing in
              it; nobody is maintaining the property. <br> Even when it is built and
              we just leave it there, in some part of the world, some other
              people will approach your land and take it. <br> Likewise, marriage is
              the beginning of where God is taking us to be a model of Christ
              and the Church. When you find a wife you need to start building
              your wife up, two of you building yourselves, just like your wife
              is a helper, the husband has a lot of role to play in meeting the
              needs of his wife. <br />
              <br />

              Going back to the earlier mentioned of “who findeth a wife findeth
              a good thing”. The art of finding, requires searching, so you
              might to have search and search and keep searching until you find
              someone. Before the marriage, a day will come when the man wants
              to surprise his wife to-be by proposing. <br> As we know, in this day
              and age and in this culture people don’t propose secretly; they
              like doing it publicly—sometimes at the mall or after the church
              service where people are gathered. <br> Maybe he makes a call to his
              soon-to-be wife and asks her to go watch a movie and when they get
              there, he shows forth the ring and kneels down and says, “Will you
              marry me?”. I call that a million dollar question became that
              question has a lot of meaning and carries a lot of weight behind
              it. <br />
              <br />
              And when it is in a public place, a place where people are many,
              the audience will be cheering ,“Say yes! Go for it! Take the
              ring!” And she may not have the time to think deeply about it,
              even though this couple might have been friends for few years or
              few a months. Let’s say she says, Yes, I will”. <br> As soon as she
              says, “Yes, I will” to him, their destinies come together. The
              destiny of the man and the woman have now matched together. And
              then the man will not stop there; they will start to think about
              wedding and then take that to the altar. <br>  When on the altar with
              the Pastor, the Pastor will ask the man, “Will you take this woman
              as your wedded wife to love and to cherish?” and then he will say
              “Yes, I do”. That statement, “Yes, I do” also carries a lot of
              weight because she doesn’t know what battles are ahead of this
              guy. She doesn’t know so much about his background. <br> She doesn’t
              know of how many demons are after him. She doesn’t know whether
              his parents have sacrificed him to one idol several years ago. She
              doesn’t know if he has secret plans in the future. <br> There may be so
              many things that she doesn’t know, regardless of the length of
              time that they have date. Let’s say she says,“Yes, I do”, or
              perhaps people are saying “Go for it! Go for it!” and she jumps at
              it and says “Yes, I do.” Although those three words are only said
              for a moment, the commitment is for a lifetime. <br> Those word that
              the couple exchanged require responsibilities and those words can
              not all the time fulfill the requirement because man is flesh and
              flesh is prompt to fail. <br> This is why the couples say, ”I do so
              help me God.” Even when they say that, there are so many moments
              that align ahead of time that they do not know. <br /><br />

              It is just wisdom to make God the center and reference point in
              the marriage, as he is the author of the marriage institution. He
              possess all the necessary tools to navigate the marital journey,
              similar to a GPS for a pleasant experience and successful
              experience for our marriages to be a light and witness on Earth!
