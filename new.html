            <p class="fw-bold fs-4 text-uppercase">Rebuilding broken walls</p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              There was a time in history, as recorded in the book of Nehemiah
              Ch 1, when the news came to Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem
              were broken, the gates burned down, and the people were depressed.
              It was so bad that it seemed there was no hope.  Both the adults
              and the children, even the animals were running around confused
              with no where to go. <br />
              <br />

              When the gate of a city is burnt and the walls are broken down,
              that city’s defense system is down, and it will be opened to
              invasion from the enemy. When a city has no barriers, enemies can
              come in, attack, invade and hold the the people hostage, so it was
              at that time in Jerusalem that the people were devastated and
              began to cry out for help. “Wow our walls are broken, our gates
              are burnt down, there seemed to be no way out.” Suddenly, God made
              a way. Help came from unexpected sources. When God makes a way, no
              man can shut it. When He say yes, no man can say no.   
              <br /><br />

              Similarly, your marriage relationship is like a wall around your
              home. Your display of love, affection, and unity are like the
              building blocks around your home. The more you and your spouse are
              in agreement in your prayers, confessions and actions, the more
              reinforcement you are adding to strengthen the marital walls of
              protection around your home. Though arguments are inevitable in
              marriages, they are acceptable as long as they do not lead to an
              unresolved or unmanageable conflict. Every fight is a crack in the
              walls of your marriage and home. The more fights, the more cracks.
              The more cracks, the weaker your marital walls around your home
              and children. Just like cracks lead to holes and holes leads to
              broken walls, broken walls leads to collapsed walls. Thus, it is
              with some marriages when care is not taken to arrest arguments
              that leads to conflicts/fights and eventual broken walls.
              <br /><br />

              There are always opportunities for broken walls but once the wife
              and the husband can unite together to build their home to avoid
              cracks and avoid broken walls, then there is no limit to the
              extent of strength and height your marital walls can become. A
              nation is not built in a day, work needs to be done in trusting
              one another,  in building together and in making that home an
              habitation of love where Godly seeds can be raised in a Godly way.
              <br /><br />

              Would you build like Nehemiah? Will you mend the broken walls of
              your marriage ? Will you pray? Will you fast? Will you seek help?
              Will you take time out? Because Nehemiah took time out from the
              king and said, “Give me some days off, I need to go build the
              walls of Jerusalem.” Will you take responsibility or will you
              point fingers? Will you take it upon yourself to build and be the
              voice of your home so that your gate can stand firm so that your
              family is protected? <br /><br />

              PRAYER God, make me a Nehemiah of my home, I can no longer allow
              crises. I can’t afford broken walls and I can’t afford a
              separation. Lord you’ve called me as a wife to be a helper, you’ve
              called me as a head, and you’ve called me as a husband to love my
              wife as Christ loves the church. <br /><br />

              Talk to God and tell Him your position, ask Him for the grace and
              the anointing to fulfill your mandate and your calling in this
              ministry called marriage and home. The home is a ministry by
              itself and you have to succeed at home to succeed outside the
              home. Shalom! <br />
