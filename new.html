            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              The beginning of the year like this is a good time to reflect on
              the situation that led to the institution of marriage. <br />
              God started on the first day to create the Earth and everything in
              it. He made man on the 6th day, and said it was not good for man
              to be alone, even though everything man needed was already in
              place even before he was created. However, God felt that something
              was still missing in the life—within this he would not be
              complete. <br />
              That is why God said in Genesis 2:18, “It is not good that the man
              should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.” That was
              how the woman was created, and the first institution of God called
              marriage began. <br />
              <b>Why marriage?</b> <br>
              The first reason for marriage as noted by God in Gen. 2:18 is for
              ‘companionship’. God does not want man to be alone. He wants man
              to have someone he could be in a relationship with, someone he
              could be naked in front and not be ashamed. Meaning both parties
              do not have to hide their vulnerabilities from each other; instead
              of being ashamed, they both see each other as part of themselves
              as the Bible states, “They are no longer two but one.” Hence, the
              mindset of both parties towards each other's vulnerabilities
              should be to help, support, and overcome weaknesses without making
              the other person feel bad about the situation or exposing each
              other’s vulnerabilities. <br />
              Some people are lonely in their marriages because their partners
              do not have time for them. Keeping each other's company is part of
              the marriage relationship covenant. Thus, they start to drift
              apart, and loneliness starts to set in, and with loneliness comes
              moodiness, depression, and exposure to all kinds of vices, etc.
              <br />
              It is important to be intentional in creating time for each other
              on a daily or weekly basis depending on both parties’ schedules.
              Setting the time/day to be together, with each person suggesting
              mutually interesting activities is very important to sustain love.
              This will enhance the couple’s closeness and intimacy. <br />
              The second reason that God initiated marriage is in the last part
              of Gen 2: 18, which states, “I will provide a help meet for him."
              God initiated marriage to be able to help each other accomplish
              many needed tasks including daily chores, assignments, obligations
              including financial, parenting, and ministerial etc. <br />
              “Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their
              labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe
              to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
              help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but
              how can one be warm alone?"- Ecc. 4:9-11. <br />
              This scripture explains the path to a fruitful, beneficial,
              productive, and safe marital life as it affects all partnerships.
              There are all kinds of problems, challenges, needs, and
              oppositions in our world, but a strong marriage partnership will
              help to confront such. Such couples will have a process of helping
              each other share the burdens; thus reducing the impact of such
              issues confronting them as they go through their difficult times.
              The overall result of having a help meet is a better quality of
              life. There is one life to live and we should aspire to live it
              well. <br />
              Sidelining one another in life choices or actions is often
              unfavorable because the possible contribution of the other party
              is absent. If often engenders strife. The reason could be due to
              upbringing, pride, ignorance etc. When we have that consciousness
              that we are no longer two, but one, we need to be intentional in
              involving our partners in what we do, maximizing the benefit of
              each other’s endowment. This will strengthen our marriages for a
              more favorable outcome to God's glory. <br />
              The third reason is to continue the work of procreation. God
              blessed Adam and Eve and said unto them, “Be fruitful, and
              multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.” -Gen 1:28. God
              blessed man and woman in marriage to be fruitful and multiply to
              continue his plan of creation. This is one of the major reasons
              the devil fights marriage, so that he can sabotage the plan of God
              for the continuation of humanity before the return of our Lord
              Jesus Christ. God wants the marital relationship to bring forth
              Godly seeds that will bruise the head of the serpent (Satan).
              <br />
              “And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
              And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed."- Malachi
              4:16. God calls the seed from a covenant marriage “a godly seed”.
              The marriage covenant is a holy matrimony, and the expectation of
              the product should be godly. <br> To further strengthen and continue
              the godliness traits in the seed, God wants both partners to team
              up together with God's help to raise and bring the seed up in the
              way of the Lord. This is one of the fundamental task given by God
              to both partners of a covenant to bring the godly seed in the way
              of the Lord in order to be a world changer for God's glory. <br />
              As we journey through this year, let's be intentional in advancing
              God’s plan for marriage and regularly ask God for grace to keep
              the marriage covenant. Whatever sacrifices we have to make will
              pay off as we are co-laborers with God in this endeavor. God will
              reward all our labor of love. <br />
              Happy new Year! <br />
              Shalom. <br />
