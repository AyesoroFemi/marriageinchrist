              MY MARRIAGE WOULD BE HEAVEN ON EARTH
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">

                    We know that in the book of Genesis chapter 2 verse 18, the Lord God said, “It is
                    not good that man should be alone, I will make him a helper comparable to him. God
                    Himself instituted marriage; He was the one that made Adam have a deep sleep,
                    and He took Eve from his side.” We must note that for us as women, we need to be
                    emotionally stable before we go into a relationship. To be happily married, we must
                    first be happily single. I know  this is addressing married people mainly, but it would
                    help those who would read  this that are still single, that to be happily married,
                    you must first be happily single. <br>
                    God ordained for us to have a happy home, and we ask ourselves “What do I
                    bring to the table?” I know most of the things I will be saying  might be in
                    question form; I might keep asking the question, “What do you bring to the table?”
                    Are you an asset or a liability? Are you a wise woman? The Bible says in Proverbs 14
                    verse 1, “A wise woman builds her house, but the foolish pulls it down with her
                    hands.” <br>
                    Are you a wise woman? Do you want your marriage to work? How are you
                    building your house? Are you building your home with love? with peace? with joy?
                    Or are you building it with bitterness? with anger? with unforgiveness? with wrath?
                    Are you hot-tempered? Are you a gossip? Do you betray confidence? Are you
                    trustworthy? Are you a lazy woman? Do you cook? Do you clean? Are you warm to
                    guests? Are you warm with your in-laws when they come to your home? Can your
                    husband bring his friends home? Can your in-laws come to your home and feel
                    welcome? Is your husband important to you? Do you show him respect? Is he
                    happy to come home to you? Or will he prefer to give excuses to stay out?
                    Do you give your husband attention? In these days of social media; we have
                    Facebook, we have WhatsApp, we have Instagram. Do you get off your phone when
                    your husband comes home? Do you see him as a king that has come home? Or do
                    you just tell him to microwave his food? Do you care for the family members of your
                    husband or is it that only your own family members matter? <br>
                    Are you a Proverbs 31 woman? I know it’s a long passage, but please, let’s get
                    back to read Proverbs 31. My favorite portion in Proverbs 31 is that “Her children rise
                    up and call her blessed; her husband also, as he praises her.” The husband praises her
                    and says, “Many daughters have done well but you excelled them all.” Is your
                    husband able to say that about you? Are your children able to call you blessed? Is
                    your husband able to bless you and praise you? I know I’m not perfect in marriage,
                    but by the grace of God, we’ve been married now for thirty-one years, and we know
                    God has been good. <br>
                    We have many Bible verses for us because for this session we have women. For
                    the wives, we have 1st Peter chapter 3, verses 1 to 6; and for the men, 1st Peter 3
                    verse 7, for the children we have Colossians 3 verse 20; and for fathers, we have
                    Colossians 3 verse 21. And also for the men, we still have Ephesians chapter 5 verse
                    25 to 33 - teaching the men to be loving, and caring, and providing, and for the wives
                    to be submissive. <br>
                    We’re talking about the fact that we want our home to be heaven on earth. The
                    story that we have in 1st Chronicles chapter 13 verses 12 to 14 comes to mind; in
                    which the ark of God was brought into the home of Obed-Edom. The ark of God was
                    brought into the home of Obed-Edom. David was even afraid when they were to
                    bring the ark of God. He was like “Oh, please ooo,” but the ark was taken into the
                    home of Obed-Edom. Just imagine that the ark is being brought into your home. <br>
                    The ark had some items - the ten commandments and some other things. It is
                    something that is of reverence. So, imagine the ark of God being put in your home. If
                    you have the ark of God in your home, I’m sure it will change the way you say things,
                    it will change what you hear and what you do. And let’s just imagine, for the next
                    three months; let’s see it as the Lord has moved into your house. Clean your house,
                    and see how God will bless you in the next three months, like Obed-Edom. Be careful
                    about what you say, what you see, what you hear, and what you do. <br>
                    And if we look at Revelation chapter 21, we’ll see Heaven with the description of
                    the new Heaven. I want to bring that home to our own home. If your home is like
                    Heaven, is it a peaceful home? Is it a place of love? Is it a place of joy? Is it a place
                    that people can find comfort? Where people can find peace? Is your husband
                    happy to be there? What are we teaching our children? Because our children are
                    always watching. They are watching. We will want to have peace in our homes, we’ll
                    want to have love in our homes; we’ll want to have joy in our homes, and everyone
                    will like to dwell in a peaceful home. <br>
                    A lot depends on the woman to set it up to be a peaceful home. For a man to
                    look forward to going home means a lot. It means a lot as to the type of woman
                    he’s going to meet at home. Do you talk on top of your voice when you have an
                    argument? Are you raising your voice? You can be right but wrong! The way you say
                    things, the tone of your voice, the way you address your husband, is it with respect?
                    Do you give him some respect? Do we love and care for one another? Do we live in
                    harmony? Can you remember what brought you together? Can you go back to your
                    first love? If everything is working well in your home, praise the Lord for that; but,
                    be vigilant. And if you’re going through the storms of life, there is negative stuff, there is a job loss, or a sickness or a disease or death in the family. Just remember
                    what the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 43 verse 2, “That when you pass through the
                    waters, I will be with you, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you.”
                    It’s telling you about when you pass through; it’s not saying you will stay in it;
                    you will only pass through. So, if there is anything that is trying to block our blessing,
                    as a woman, if there is anything that is trying to block your blessing or block the joy
                    in your home or the peace in your home or the harmony in your home, you need to
                    stand in the gap for the family. You cannot afford to sleep too much. You need to
                    pray for your husband; you need to pray for your children; you need to pray for
                    yourself; you need to pray about anything and everything. You need to pray that the
                    Lord will make your home Heaven on earth. <br>
                    If there is any attack, we thank God for how God has wired us women; we are
                    able to sense some things before they even happen. We should always be ready, on
                    our knees, standing in the gap, and always pray that “Lord, please, may You bless my
                    home. Please Lord, may You make my home Heaven on Earth.”
                    Lord, may You please help us have a loving, joyful, and peaceful home. We
                    come against every blessing grabber, we come against every blessing blocker in our
                    homes in the name of Jesus. Anything that wants to destabilize our home, anything
                    that would want to steal the joy, the peace, the love in our home, we stand against it
                    in the name of Jesus. <br> <br>

                    And we need to remember to please write a respect card for our husband. Write
                    a respect card for your husband; be grateful for what he does. Does he pay the
                    mortgage, pay the rent, pay the bill, clean your car, cook for you, take care of the
                    children, love you, care for you; decide to compliment him, decide to emphasize
                    what he is doing right, not what he is not doing right. For the next three months,
                    let’s just start with this exercise; let’s do the respect card, let’s show our husband
                    love, let’s appreciate them, and let’s emphasize what they are doing that is pleasing,
                    that is right. Let’s pray for peace in our home; let’s pray for joy in our home; let’s
                    pray for harmony and let’s stand in the gap, so that, if there is any form of attack,
                    anything that is negative that is trying to attack our home, we will be able to attack it in the place of prayer. And the Lord will help us in the mighty name of Jesus. 
                    Hallelujah to the Lord, we give God praise, we could have heaven on Earth in our homes in the name of Jesus.  Heaven on Earth is our portion in Jesus mighty name. <br>
