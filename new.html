              NEW BEGINNING
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
                We give thanks to God almighty for bringing us to this new year 2022. All glory and honor be unto Him. Even though last year came to an end, nothing good is coming to an end in our lives, nothing good is coming to an end in our marriages. <br>
                God has much better things in store for us. He is not done with us yet. He says to us that even though eyes have not seen, ears have not heard, neither has it come to the hearts of men, what God has prepared for them that love him.  <br>
                And I believe this is our promise for this year 2022. God has better things in store for us, better things in store for our marriages, better things in store for our children and for our homes. Exodus chapter 14 from verse 13 says, "Fear not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord." You know many times we tend to fear when we are at a situation or road cross. <br>
                Even though our marriages may have not been the best in 2021, even though our marriages could have gone through roller coasters in 2021, even though we had lots of struggles going through mountains and valleys, yet the Word is telling us tonight fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. God has great things in store for us, in other words, He is trying to tell us to not be discouraged my daughter, don't be discouraged my son, do not give up, do not throw up the towel, do not give up to fight. <br>
                As we see in that same passage verse 13b, "For the Egyptians that you see today, you shall see them no more forever." In other words, the struggles that we see today in our marriages, the arguments, the misunderstandings, God says we will see them no more in the coming year in Jesus name. <br>
                As it is in the book of Nahum chapter one verse nine it says, "God has made an utter end of affliction, affliction will not rise the second time." As last year rolled off, so are these struggles and frustration rolled off, and in this new year, we look forward to a new height to a new and better relationship. <br> 
                Our spouses are not our enemies. The bible says, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality, against powers, against rulers of darkness, against spiritual wickedness." We need to fight this battle together, marriage is work, marriage has a fight to it, it is not always bed and roses, for the most part it's a fight. We need to have God by our side, going back to the passage verse 14 says, "The Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace." Even though we have enemies fighting against our peace and marriages, the Bible says that in all these things we should not fear, we should stand still and see the salvation of the Lord for He shall fight for us. <br> 
                The statistics today show that the percentage of divorce in Christian homes is 50%! This is very discouraging for us and for our youth and children, but the battle is not over. The devil is a liar. God is all out to make sure that His plan for marriages on earth becomes a good success so that the youth can follow through. In the book of Habbakuk chapter three verse seventeen, it says, "Though the fig tree does not blossom, nor the fruits on the vines ripe, though the labor of the olive may fail and the fields with no food yet will I rejoice, yet will I be joyful in my God." We know that the battle is the Lord; we know that our spouses are not our enemies; God is the one who ordained marriage, and we know His hand solidly behind us in this race. <br>
                Therefore we will not be discouraged, therefore we will not throw in the towel, therefore we will move forward in the mighty name of Jesus. Verse fifteen of that same passage say,s "And the Lord said unto Moses why are you crying unto me, speak to the children of Israel that they go forward." God is saying the same thing to us today. He that has kept us together in 2021 is able to do it again in this new year and is asking us to plan to move forward. God is bringing the word to us that we need to move forward in our marital relationship. We need to move forward in building our homes, building Godly homes with Godly pillars with the strong words of God. We need to move forward in interceding for our homes and children. <br> 
                We need to move forward in our love for one another, we need to move forward in being a peacemaker. <br>
                When there is no peace in the home there is turbulence, and even though there may be obstacles, even though there may be mountains and valleys, if you can see the other side of the mountain you can move it. If you can see the romantic Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden with God in their midst fellowshipping together and having a sweet time, and if you can see that heaven on earth in your marriage you will move the mountains. You will do anything to move the mountains. With God all things are possible. 
                Do not be an accuser of your spouse, the devil is the accuser of the brethren. Instead, be his greatest fan, be your spouse's number 1 cheerleader. <br> We need to enrich one another, not accuse one another because there is no perfect partner. Number two is when you talk to your spouse remove the words "you" and "why" and replace the word "you" with "I", and replace the word "why" with "we". In other words.
                Instead of saying to your husband “Hey honey, why did not you call on your way home to tell me that you were hungry?” you could say “Honey I could have called you on your way home to find out what you want to eat”. Using the words "we" and "I" helps us to avoid accusations in our conversation and it can help us to move our marriage forward in the coming year. Number 3 put your ego down. This applies mostly to men. Let's put our ego down, be the first to apologize, be the first to make peace. Let this be a competition. Let us see who will apologize first. When one apologizes the other should follow up with an apology as well. Number 4 is to make time and spend time together alone regularly. If you don't make time, the time will never come that you can spend quality time together and this time I am recommending an appreciation date night. It is the night to come out and appreciate one another, I recommend each one come up with a surprise gift and a list of things you appreciate. You can plan it monthly to come together and find a good place and go there to appreciate one another and exchange gifts. This is one of the ways we can move our marriages forward in this new year. <br> <br>
                In conclusion, the book of Psalm 102 verse 13 says, "I will arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her is now." God is saying in 2022, I will arise and have mercy on your home on your marriage the time to move forward is now. It is time to begin to plan for a new awakening and a new horizon. It is time for your marriage to blossom and be fruitful in this new year. The only person that can keep your marriage from moving forward in this new year is you, and the only thing that can keep you from moving forward is your past.
                <br><br>
                Make a quality decision that will help you and your marriage move forward in your life this year, and heaven will back you up.
                <br> <br>
                Shalom!
                <br><br>
