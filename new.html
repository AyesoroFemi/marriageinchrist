            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              This month we celebrate Valentines, we celebrate Love.
              <br /><br />

              When it comes to the topic of love, everyone has their different
              ways of viewing the concept of love. Everyone has different ways
              of perceiving, giving, and receiving love. <br /> <br>

              First, let’s look at the origins of love. The Bible tells us that
              GOD is LOVE, and that he who does not love does not know God, for
              God is love (1John 4:8). So, this is telling us that it's
              impossible to Love the right and lasting way without God being in
              it. Human love is selfish and it's usually about I and myself;
              what is in it for me? If there is nothing to gain, human love
              backs out. <br /> <br>

              The first love that shows up in any marital relationship is often
              based on attraction, and it cannot pass the test of time because
              it's conditional; it depends on outside appearance, achievements,
              and these are all transient things that do not last. Hence, this
              love disappears in the absence of those initial attraction’s
              forces. Hence, trouble starts when the responsible factors for the
              love in the first place disappear or lose their appeal. That's
              when partners start to have conflicts that are hard to settle,
              because the binding factor is no longer present. <br /> <br>

              The Love of God that is unconditional should be our main goal in
              relating with our partners. This love is unconditional and can
              stand the test of time because it's not dependent on anything.
              It's just purely that God kind of love. How did God demonstrate
              this love towards us? <br /> <br>

              1. Compassion: The Bible says Jesus moved with compassion when he
              saw the people look like sheep without shepherd. We can relate to
              this in the weaknesses or inadequacies we see in our partners. For
              the most part, they cannot even see what we see in them or that
              they do to upset us. We see the way Jesus responded to the people
              was that of compassion that compelled him to go beyond the
              ordinary and performed a miracle to meet their needs of providing
              food for them. So when we identify the weaknesses of our partners,
              it should create a heart of compassion of “how can I help
              him/her?”. As long as we have a willing heart, God will supply the
              grace and necessary tools to help, even to the point of performing
              miracles for that need to be met like Jesus did. <br /> <br>

              2. God gave: The Bible says "For God so loved the world that he
              gave his only...’ (John 3:16) - what are you willing to give or
              give up in that relationship no matter how costly? It may not be
              an easy thing to do at times because every human has that inborn
              selfish nature. However, if we can be intentional with our giving
              or giving up things that are detrimental to our relationship, we
              will go a long way to replicate the unconditional love of God in
              our relationship. One of the things I love about God is the
              encouragement He provides with each instruction. The Bible says
              when you give, it shall be given unto you. God, our example, was
              able to gain many sons to glory after giving us his son to the
              point of death (Hebrews 2:10) <br /> <br>

              3. God loves us by giving us a free will: When God created
              mankind, He gave him something powerful and unique. Man received a
              free will, so that he could make his own choices based on his own
              free will. In following the example of God, we should give our
              partners their free will to make their choices in life, we can
              encourage them, but not to control or force anything on them. Even
              when we see they are going the wrong way, we should just pray that
              God will help them and keep them from making costly mistakes.
              <br /> <br>

              4. God loves us even when we were yet sinners, that is before we
              have even got to the change He desires in us, he still
              demonstrates love towards us. Remember while we were yet sinners
              Christ died for us (Rom. 5:8). <br /> <br>

              Many times in relationships, people get frustrated because they
              are trying to change their spouses, but we are not called to
              change anyone- it is the job of the Holy Spirit. All we are
              commanded to do is to love people unconditionally like God's love
              for you is unconditional and undeserved. He loves you despite your
              disobedience, your selfishness, your weakness, and your sins. He
              loves you enough to provide a way to abundant, eternal life. God
              expects us to love our partners as they are before they get to
              that place of change we want of them. <br /> <br>

              5. God shows us grace and mercy: The Bible makes us understand
              it’s the grace of God that brings every sinner to repentance.
              Thus, God wants us to be able to demonstrate our love for our
              partners by showing them grace, overlooking their faults, and by
              giving them things they don't deserve by their actions or
              inactions. <br /> <br>

              The Bible says the mercy of God is new every morning. God wants us
              to show our partners mercy by demonstrating our love for them
              through not punishing or giving them the treatment we feel they
              deserve from their misbehavior towards us. <br /> <br>

              Wishing everyone a happy Valentine’s Day and in demonstration of
              God's unconditional love in our relationships in Jesus’ name.
              <br /> <br>

              Shalom. <br />
