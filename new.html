              "The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt
              long enough at this mountain"- Deuteronomy 1:6 <br />

              Whenever the month of March is approaching, the image that comes
              to my mind is that of its literal meaning in its present
              continuous adjective - marching. <br />
              As we know, marching is a form of exercise that we engage in order
              to keep our muscles strong and toned to keep fit or attain
              fitness. <br />
              It is also done by the military as they advance towards a
              destination in a formation during the parade. Whichever way we
              look at it, it refers to ‘not standing still’, but ‘moving,
              advancing’ toward an objective. <br />
              From our earlier passage, we see that God does not want us to stay
              in the same spot. He wants us to keep moving in our relationships,
              especially our marital relationship. <br />
              After we have been married for a while, there is a tendency to
              keep things still, as we get inundated with responsibilities of
              the children, home, extended families, and in-laws while
              attempting to advance our careers at the same time. <br />
              Balancing work and family life tends to override everything else
              and keep things stagnant in the relationship. Marching is an
              action word; it takes intentionality to march forward against all
              the obstacles and pressures of life to keep the relationship alive
              - moving forward. <br />
              What did God instruct the children of Israel to do when confronted
              with the red sea, which was one of their obstacles from reaching
              their promised land? “And the LORD said unto Moses, wherefore
              criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they
              go forward:” Ex. 14:15. <br />
              We must be determined to move forward! What are some of the
              obstacles that can be in our way of marching forward in our
              marriage? <br /><br />

              <b>1. Poor communication: </b> <br />
              Communication is like the blood circulation in the body, and when
              blood circulation stops, the body parts start to die gradually.
              This is similar to when couples do not communicate effectively in
              their relationships. Today's busy schedule could be a big factor,
              especially if both partners are operating different work
              schedules, the tendency to miss out on communication may be very
              high. Thus, there is a need for intentionality, which might look
              like creating time alone together a couple of times a week to talk
              about current issues. <br /> It will be good to have things jotted down
              so that the most pending issues can be talked over during this
              time. To create the time and space for these conversations,
              couples with young children can have the oldest one (if mature
              enough) watch the younger ones in another room or have these
              conversations when all of them have gone to school. Also, be
              intentional to communicate from the heart by calling and checking
              on each other daily during work time breaks. We may not even have
              anything to talk about in mind. It could be, just calling to check
              on you, just calling to say, "I love you." <br /><br />

              <b>2. Lack of intimacy:</b> <br />
              Sometimes couples don't recognize the need to build space for
              intimate moments in their lives. Sex has long been recognized as a
              natural tranquilizer that also strengthens bonds between couples.
              Most of the time, couples expect that physical intimacy will be
              spontaneous. As we grow older, the spontaneity wanes. <br /> The
              circumstances have to be cultivated to improve our mood; we have
              to remove all obstacles occasioned by the stresses of life. <br />
              Couples are sometimes advised to schedule time for emphasis. It
              should not be mechanical (just to fulfill all righteousness), but
              we need to communicate our preferences as we age. There is so much
              legitimate help and resources out there to improve our skill set
              in this area. When we truly enjoy something, we want more of it. <br />
              Physical intimacy is not only about sex alone, it’s also about
              touch and closeness between bodies. Romantic relationships can
              include a warm hug when parting or arriving at home, sitting close
              to each other to watch TV, holding hands to pray, cuddling/
              sleeping close to each other( spooning position recommended). All
              these may require intentionality to engage daily and on a routine
              basis. <br /><br />

              <b>3. Growing apart: </b> <br />
              As children of God, we are expected to keep growing in our
              Christian walk. Oftentimes, when couples fail to grow together in
              their relationship, they start to grow apart. It's important that
              we both encourage each other to grow together by attending church
              together, having daily devotion, and getting to be involved in the
              work of the ministry together. <br /> All of these will keep both parties
              growing together and moving forward in the marriage. Outside
              influences: Issues with in-laws, friends, and family should be
              kept in the right places. Whenever problems arise, they should be
              resolved with input from both parties with agreement on how
              avoid/minimize extraneous influences in the relationship as they
              can be hindrances from keeping the marriage moving forward. <br /> <br/>

              <b>4. No demonstration of love and respect: </b><br />
              The Bible instructs husbands to love their wives like Christ loves
              the Church and gave himself up for her.  <br /> That's the example the
              Bible gave for how a husband should love his wife. In the same
              manner, the Bible encourages the wife to respect her husband. <br /> The
              example given in the Bible of a respectful woman is that of Sara,
              and the way she demonstrated that respect from the Bible is that
              she referred to him in reference and respect by calling him Lord
              ;- 1Peter 3:6. I know for some it's easier to refer to our pastors
              that might even be younger than our husbands as "sirs", while we
              just call our husbands by their given names. Finding pet names
              that depict love and respect will be a tool in maintaining and
              keeping our marriage moving forward. <br />

              Engaging in all these will keep us empowered to overcome
              hindrances in our relationships, keep our marriage alive, and help
              us in marching forward for God's glory to be seen as God designed
              it to be. <br /><br />
              Shalom! <br />
