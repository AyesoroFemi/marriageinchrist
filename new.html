              Uniqueness of the unity in the Trinity and lessons for Christian
              marriages.
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              As we enter the last month of the year, it's a good time to
              reflect on the season and in relation to our lives and marriages.
              <br />

              This is the month our savior that was sent to redeem us was born.
              <br />

              Our marriages are to mirror Christ and the church relationship.
              However, recently I was pondering on the relationship that occurs
              between the Trinity, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy
              Spirit. <br />

              There are lessons to learn from the Trinity relationship in our
              marriage that makes them work together seamlessly. <br /> <br>

              - The Trinity work together in unity; Genesis 1:26 "And God said,
              Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them
              have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
              air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
              creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth". <br />

              The Trinity work together in Collaboration and unity when God was
              going to create man, he involved the other 2 parties in the
              Trinity, when he said "let us make" man in our own image, after
              our likeness, which is the trio: Spirit, Soul and Body. <br />

              Marriage is thus designed to be a unity driven relationship, and
              in equality. 1Peter 3:7 "Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with
              your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as
              unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of
              life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered". Perceiving
              each other as joint heirs in a marital relationship will demand
              for treating each other with respect, valuing each other’s
              opinion, not making a crucial decision without consulting with the
              other party. <br /> <br>

              - The Trinity yield to each other’s will, Luke 22:42 "Saying,
              Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless,
              not my will, but thine, be done". As married couples we should be
              willing to yield our will to the other partner sacrificially. The
              bible encourages us that we should always watch out for the
              interest of the other. James 4:1 makes us understand that it's our
              selfish nature that causes us to fight and wants to have it our
              own way at all times. <br /> <br>

              -The Trinity listens to each other, “And I knew that thou hearest
              me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it,
              that they may believe that thou hast sent me.”- John 11:42.
              Married couples need to cultivate the habit of listening to each
              other, not only listening but hearing what is being said and
              responding accordingly. <br />

              We should always be ready to be sensitive to our partner's need.
              <br />

              The Trinity work together in humility; Phil 2:5-7" Let this mind
              be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form
              of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made
              himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,
              and was made in the likeness of men". <br />

              Relating with each other in humility in a marital relationship is
              crucial to the success and bliss of the marriage. Just like Christ
              did not regard his equality with God as something to be arrogant
              or taken advantage of, in a marital relationship the same should
              apply. The hearts should be in a state of lowliness and
              tenderness. <br /> <br>

              -The unity works together to affirm and glorify themselves: John
              17:5 <br />

              "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
              glory which I had with thee before the world was". <br />

              Couples need to cultivate the habit of encouraging each other by
              words of affirmation and amplifying the graces of God in their
              partners. This act gives encouragement in the marital journey and
              empowers us to do better in the relationship and in general.
              <br />

              In addition, our marriages are supposed to mirror the relationship
              of Jesus Christ and the church, this season as we celebrate
              Jesus's birth, we should reflect on his sacrificial love for the
              church (his bride) to redeem us from our sins, and present
              blameless before the father. This should be the attitude of
              husbands to their wives, to die in the flesh by overlooking their
              shortcomings and looking for ways to help them overcome their
              weaknesses instead of criticizing or attending to them in a
              condescending or contemptuous manner. The bible says a couple have
              become one flesh, and no one will treat their flesh in ways that
              are unbecoming as earlier mentioned, but instead nourish and
              cherish it. The expectation of Christ from the church(bride) in
              response to the act of his sacrificial love is that of reaction of
              respect as stated in Eph. 5:33 "Nevertheless let every one of you
              in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see
              that she reverence her husband". Wives should find ways show
              respect to their husbands with the help of the Holy Spirit. The
              results will bring peace, harmony and bliss to the marital
              relationship for God's name to be glorified. <br />

              Shalom, <br />
