            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              Marriage is a place where it can be easy to forget that it's not
              about getting only all our own desires met, but rather it is all
              about serving each other and following the example of Christ.
              <br />
              Husbands are admonished to love their wives as Christ loves the
              church (Ephesians 5:25) and "…young women to be sober, to love
              their husbands, to love their children,” (Titus 2:4). Jesus is our
              example of how to treat each other in our marriages. <br /> <br>

              The Easter season that was just concluded is always a big time of
              reflection of the selfless sacrifice up to the point of death
              Jesus, the groom, made for us his bride - the Church. It's very
              mind-blowing that Jesus went through all that to pay the price for
              our redemption. It is very difficult to find people who might
              consider dying for someone who is innocent and guiltless. No man
              will ever want to die for a sinful and hard to get along with
              person. However, that is what Jesus did for us. <br /> <br>

              How could He have done this? What was His motivation? The Bible
              made us understand that Jesus endured the cross for our sake,
              considering the JOY that was set before him. What JOY? The joy of
              the outcome of His death. The JOY of our redemption and bringing
              many sons to glory. We are therefore encouraged to look unto
              Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. <br /> <br>

              We do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little
              while [by taking on the limitations of humanity], crowned with
              glory and honor because of His suffering of death, so that by the
              grace of God [extended to sinners] He might experience death for
              [the sins of] everyone. (Hebrew 12:2). For it was fitting for God
              [that is, an act worthy of His divine nature] that He, for whose
              sake are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing
              many sons to glory, should make the author and founder of their
              salvation perfect through suffering [bringing to maturity the
              human experience necessary for Him to be perfectly equipped for
              His office as High Priest]."(Hebrews 2: 9-10 - Amplified Version).
              Jesus being our perfect example, we are commanded to follow his
              footsteps because he said , "We will do greater works than he
              did." (John 14:11) <br /> <br>

              While there's no need for us to die physically for anyone, there
              is one death that is needed, and we have been commanded to die.
              When the bible tells us to die in our flesh. Colossians 3:5-11
              says to put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly
              nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and
              greed, ... Apostle Paul said, "I die daily."(1Corinthians 15:31).
              I believe Paul said this because he knew that he needed to be
              intentional by reminding himself every day to walk in the newness
              of life by "dying daily" to the flesh. <br /> <br>

              How do we die to ourselves in our relationship with our spouses?
              It is when we put the needs of our spouses before ours - we are
              being dead to flesh. <br /> <br>

              <b>
                Let's look at some practical ways we can put the needs of our
                spouses over our own.
              </b>
              <br /> <br>
              <b>
                1. We need to first humble ourselves daily before both the Lord
                and our spouse and pray for God to help us serve each other with
                love daily.
              </b>
              <br /> <br>

              <b>2. We need to be quick to forgive and forget.</b> We should
              always extend the grace that we received from God to our spouses
              as well. The easy way to forget is to stop thinking and talking or
              bringing the offense up from time to time. Just as God forgave us
              by wiping all our sins with the blood of Jesus and not making us
              accountable once he has forgiven us, that is the way he wants us
              to forgive our spouses and even others as well. <br /> <br>

              <b> 3. Appreciation</b> - being generous in giving praise. The
              Bible says we should speak words that will edify one another. Some
              people might feel less of themselves when they offer praise to
              their partners. When we remind ourselves that it's a way of dying
              to self and edifying your partner, He will supply the courage to
              make it a habit. Some also might feel it may make their partners
              get puffed up by praising them. We need not worry about that. We
              just need to be obedient to the word of God and play our own part.
              We should refrain from playing the part of the Holy Spirit in
              their lives. <br /> <br>

              As time passes, and years add up, staying in love can get
              increasingly challenging, because responsibilities also grow.
              However, it's possible to still stay in love with being
              intentional in dying to self everyday, which will make our
              partners feel more connected and loved. <br />

              God uses our marriage to refine and grow us! <br />

              As a married couple, the opportunity to serve each other is
              presented to us daily when we keep our flesh constantly in check
              and in alignment with the word of God. We might occasionally mess
              up because we are still human, but the most important need is for
              us to have a willing heart and a mindset/consciousness of dying to
              the flesh daily. As we continue to embark on this journey, God
              starts to shine through us more and more; then, our marriages can
              be a witness for Christ and bring more glory to God. <br /> <br>

              Shalom! <br />
