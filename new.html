            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              With the recent uproar and disturbing news of the Nigerian singer, Sister Osinachi,  the awareness of abuse in whatever forms it represents has been brought into the limelight  and almost everyone has something to say on how this should have been prevented. The consensus is that she should have left the abusive marriage.  This has produced an awareness that a one size fits all solution does not work for all. Many women have been secretly enduring and hoping, like Sis Osinachi, that the abuser will change. Abuse of any kind should not be acceptable in the Church of Christ, as this translates to the abuse of Christ himself.  When Christ is the head of the body, and the body is the church, His bride, any abuse on the body will be felt by Christ,  hence abuse of any kind should not be lightly taken.
              In the light of everything going on, we will possibly have more separation and even higher divorce rates on the rise amongst Christians. Hence, the church needs to get prepared for how to handle this impending problems that will be on the rise sooner or later.
              We need more teaching and training on correctly dividing the Word of truth on the issues of marriage.  
              While divorce should still not be an option(except on the ground of adultery as stated in the Bible), in the case where the abuse threatens life, separation is advised until the abuser gets the necessary help needed to be able to relate in a Godly manner towards their spouses. The separation should be seen as a temporary measure with prayers,  professional counseling, etc. The abuser will need a genuine repentance and seek for restoration with God and the partner in a serious manner.
              The abused should not see this as a way of abandoning their marriages, as every possible steps to reconciliation in a safe manner should be sought out first.  The Bible encourages in such case that if reconciliation is not possible afterall, both parties should remain unmarried.
              <br/> <br/>
                  <b>Causes of Abuse in Marriage and Suggested Prevention and Management. </b> <br/>

                For the majority, people get married with the hope of having a forever happily after, however, when they take a look at their marriage one day, the dream of a loving and kind spouse is far gone. <br/>
                The person they trust with their life and happiness is now the one causing them the most heartache and often jeopardizing their health and safety.<br/>

                In addressing marital abuse, it is important to know the underlying causes, in order to be effective in addressing it.<br/>

                From research, below is a list of four out of some reasons why abuse happens in marriage. <br/> <br/> 

                <b>1. Trigger-thoughts:</b>

                Research shows that the violence in a marital argument arises from a sequence of detrimental thoughts and these thoughts present as distorted images of reality. <br/> 

                Although it's common for a relationship to have its set ways of arguments that may be unproductive, in abusive relationships these thoughts are the leading causes of violence and abuse that are dangerous for the victim. Some examples are: <br/> 

                "She is being disrespectful." "I can't let her go away with the thinking that I am weak." "Who does she think she is speaking to me like that?"  "Such behavior needs to be brought to reason by force," etc. <br/> 

                Once all these thoughts are being welcomed and replayed in the abusers' mind, the violence is said to become imminent. <br/> 

                The answer to that is found in Phillipians 8:4.

                "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things." <br/> 

                Abusive behavior can be overpowered if the thoughts that are contrary to the above is being dealt with at the slightest realisation, by casting them down, as the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10:4-5: 

                "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." <br/> 

                Also the Bible tells us in 1 Cor. 13:7 that "love believes and looks for the best in each person." So, if each partner walks in the light of making room for their spouses mistakes, unintentional error, and believing that whatever their spouses said must have come from a good intention, they will be able to defeat the devil's devices of misrepresentation of actions and spoken words. <br/> <br/> 

                <b>2. Inability to tolerate being hurt: </b>

                It can be very difficult to deal with situations of being hurt by someone we love, but living and sharing life with the everyday stress, unplanned circumstances that may bring hardship will usually lead to being hurt and disappointed at times. <br> Most people deal with such situations without becoming violent or psychologically abusive towards their spouses. However, the people that have the tendency to be abusive, have the weakness of being unable to tolerate the wrong done to them, they tend to exhibit the abusive behavior as a reaction to the pain by inflicting pain on others. They have difficulty in able to handle the feelings of anxiety, appearing weak, vulnerable, or being put down in any way. So, the abuse comes from reacting and attacking the victim relentlessly. <br>

                The answer to that is found in Phillipians  2:5-8.
 
                "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

                Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:

                But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

                And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." <br>

                The result of exhibitting and growing in this virtue will bring peace and exalt the person exercising it as stated in vs 9 of that chapter. <br> <br>

               <b> 3. Growing up in an abusive family:</b> Although research has shown that not every abuser comes from an abusive family, however culprits of spousal abuse often come from a family in which the dynamics were toxic.

                The laws of growth says;

                You become what you behold, and you conform to the conversations around you, hence the probability of being an abuser due to growing up in an abusive marriage is very high. <br>

                Answer to this: 

                For our youth getting ready in marriage, please find out the history of the person, and if there was an abusive background in the upbringing. Have a plan for him/her to go through some counselling and be on guard, using the Word of God to affirm that they are new creatures, renew their minds that they can do all things through Christ who gives strength, including the ability not to be abusive towards their partners. <br>

                They should also have a mentor or someone they can be accountable to on a regular basis. <br> <br>

               <b> 4. Lack of empathy:</b> This is an expected reason that enables abusers to act in violence against their partners. Lack of empathy from the abusers part makes them often see limitations and weaknesses of others clearly, which controls their actions towards their victims.

                Answer to this:

                Getting a conscious awareness that everyone has weaknesses and flaws that should come with care and sharing of others' feeling in a compassionate manner, just as instructed in the book of Ephesians 4:32. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." <br>

                Research shows that putting the abuser in the victim's shoes using an immersive virtual reality system, the abusers were able to realize the feelings of their victims and improved their perception of emotions. The story of David's lack of perception and empathy as recorded in the book of 2 Samuel 11 & 12 came to play as an example.  When the story of what he did was being narrated to him, not knowing he was the culprit in the story, he passed the judgement of death on himself, which helped him better understand his actions. <br>

                These are just some of the causes,  Christian marriages are supposed to mirror the relationship between Christ and the Church. The husband should be prepared to meet the need of his wife like Christ did and is still doing. Christ gave His life up to show His love in action for the Church to the point of death in all ramifications.  <br>

                The Bible says the wife should be submissive and see that she respects her husband.  If wives can respect their husbands like they respect their Pastors, bosses at work there will be less friction in the marital relationship. <br>

                We pray for Grace for every one in marital relationships to take their posts in their homes as instructed by God, the author of the marriage institute. <br />
