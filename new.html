            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              We play sports for recreation and some play sports as a livelihood
              but whatever our case is, our goal is often to win. <br> In individual
              sports like many track and field events, singles tennis etc., it
              takes just the individual to win. He practices, gets the right
              gear, and does whatever it takes to win. We cannot say the same of
              team sports like soccer, basketball, football etc. The likes of
              Maradona, Messi in soccer; Stephen Curry, Lebron James, Kevin
              Durant in basketball or great quarterbacks like Tom Brady, Ben
              Roethlisberger in football did not win championships by
              themselves, they had a supporting cast although they may be
              earning a lot more than any member of their supporting casts. <br>
              Teamwork is an integral and essential part of the team success.
              They often talk of ‘locker room mentality’ – what they do out of
              the view of the spectators for team success. They play and follow
              the rules; they are disciplined in training and their personal
              lives. They do not want to let down the team on and off the court.
              They eat, sleep, dream in the hope of ultimate victory – the
              championship! <br />

              However, when it comes to marriage, we tend to ignore the power of
              team work. We tend to behave like we really don’t need each other.
              <br />

              Going down memory lane, when God instituted marriage, He said it
              was not good that a man should be alone in Genesis 2:18. He
              created a helper, a team mate that can both keep each other's
              company, and go through life together and be more productive.
              <br />
              As the Bible says, " Two are better than one, because they have a
              good return for their labor. " - Ecc. 4:9-10 <br /> <br>

              <b>Ways to show teamwork spirit </b><br />
              The need to be intentional is important to show and <br />
              maintain a team mentality, which includes: <br />

              1. Checking on your spouse daily to see how they are faring when
              you both are not physically together. If Adam and Eve had been in
              close communication there would not have been any room for the
              devil to take advantage of any one of them. <br /> <br>

              2. Involve your spouse in your decision making. Nothing should be
              too small or too big to leave your spouse out of. A team mentality
              will make sure team members are on the same page as they are..
              <br /> <br>

              3. Supporting your spouse in whatever they do. You may not
              necessarily agree or like the activities that interest your
              spouse, but just making yourself available to them goes a long way
              to show that you care. This will likely make them feel supported
              by you. <br /> <br>
              Also, in trying to understand what their interests are, this is an
              act of effort to connect that will strengthen the relationship
              even more. <br /> <br>

              4. Create time to do things together. <br />
              Researchers at Brigham Young University found that couples are
              happier when they do household chores together. The best part?
              They also found that it isn't the actual division of labor that
              matters; it's how satisfied the couple is with that division of
              labor. So, create time to talk about the ongoing chores. Divide
              them up in a way that works for you both. Set a time you both can
              engage in them, even if it's once a week. <br /> <br>

              5. Speak the same language. Never appear divided to your children
              or outsiders. Children who see these holes in their parents'
              spirit of teamwork may tend to take advantage of this to have
              their ways. <br /> <br>

              6. Never put down your spouse or what they say in public even if
              you don't agree with what they say. Try not to antagonize or
              openly oppose each other, rather get together in private to
              resolve things and come to a conclusion. <br />
              God created the marriage institution for us to complement and
              complete each other; not for division or individual score keeping.
              <br /> <br>

              7. Have the mentality that whatever you have belongs to your
              spouse, and should be allowed free access to them. As the Bible
              says, God has joined both husband and wife together, and let
              nothing put them asunder by way of division of material things.
              <br /> <br>

              8. Encourage each other by acknowledging and affirming their areas
              of strength. <br />
              When you encourage your partner, is like you are empowering them
              to be the best version of themselves. Hence this will enhance
              their performance and overall productivity in your relationship.
              <br /> <br>

              A team mentality will leave both partners feeling supported,
              regardless of who is doing what, or what is going on. <br />
              As a member of a team, you have a loving co-collaborator to
              consult with and rely upon when needed. You share things, goals,
              vision together and plan how to accomplish them. <br />
              This will not only bring oneness into your marriage as designed by
              God, it will bring a sense of peace and harmony in the marital
              relationship. <br />
              Shalom! <br />
