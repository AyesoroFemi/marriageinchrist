            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              When we get married we are given our marriage certificates before
              attempting the tests in the courses of our marriages. I see the
              certificates as questions/problems that need our ability to answer
              those questions correctly determines our marital successes. <br />
              <br />
              Since there is no school for marriage, most of the time we start
              to answer our marital questions with our prior past experiences,
              possibly what we  see in other people's marriage before we got
              married, like our parents, family members, friends, culture, our
              own personal preferences/ideas etc. However, since God is the
              author of marriage, it is vital for us to have the knowledge of
              his laid down principles when he instituted marriage. It is very
              important to know that each marriage is unique with God's plan for
              individual marriage. Hence, using another marriage's manuscript
              for our own marriage is defeating God's plan and purpose for it.
              It is imperative   to know what the questions are in that
              marriage. Some are very obvious, some are deeper than on the
              surface and take time and revelational knowledge to discover;
              hence we need patience and God's help to unravel these questions
              in our marriages. <br />
              <br />
              The next step is to ask and receive directions on how to solve
              these questions. Getting specific directions on how to solve these
              questions are very vital,  the same question in another
              relationship may not respond to the answer that will solve the
              question in your own marital relationship. That is why it's not
              good to compare your marriage with another marriage. This leads to
              frustration, because comparison is a robber of Joy. It takes
              intentionality to understand our questions in our marriage, we
              actually need to understand ourselves as we strive to understand
              our partners as well.  <br />

              We need to pray for the Holy Spirit to reveal to us who we are,
              our weaknesses and that of our partners.  Then we can now go to
              God to give us the strategies to apply in our relationships so our
              differences can complement each other, rather than be sources of
              conflicts. As the Bible says," And we know that in all things God
              works for the good of those who love him, who have been called
              according to his purpose"- Rom. 8:28. <br />
              <br />

              God wants us to grow up spiritually, but on our way to growth, he
              will even make our weaknesses work together for our good and his
              divine purposes in our marriages. <br />
              <br />
              Our aim as we move forward in our marital relationship is to focus
              on each other's strength, and demonstrate unconditional love to
              our partners in the areas of their weaknesses, look for ways to
              help them in theses areas of weaknesses rather than being
              resentful and complaining about them We are not called to force
              growth on our partners or anyone. The bible says "owe no man
              anything, but to LOVE one another"- Prov. 13:18. <br />
              <br />
              As we journey in our marriage, let us make LOVE our greatest quest
              as we unravel our questions, and address them with God's
              strategies and power. <br />
              <br />

              Shalom! <br />
