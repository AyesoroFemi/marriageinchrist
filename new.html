              THE CHOICE IS YOURS
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              Sometimes we keep praying that our spouse will change, however, CHANGE starts with us. It's about the choices we make. There's the right way and there's the wrong way. <br>

             <br> <b> THE CHOICE IS YOURS.</b> <br>
              
              “So the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? 7 If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.”  Gen 4:6-7. <br> <br>
              
              Covid-19 has put new perspectives on relationships and challenges for husband and wife, proving that close proximity breeds conflict. <br> <br>
              It’s all about <b>CHOICES</b> <br>
              God told Cain that he had choices between good and evil. He chose selfishness which led to envy and then to hatred. He needed to change his attitude and approach. <br>
              This is the same with our relationship: if you change the way you look at things, what you are looking at will eventually change. <br>
              <b>Your choices either will deepen your relationship or damage it! </b> <br>
              You must make purposeful choices, be intentional and consciously make a choice that will lift up your spouse, your marriage and not bring down it. <br>
              The <b>CHOICE</b> is yours. <br>
              Cain blamed Abel for his failures and resulted in Abel’s death. We don’t kill physically but we kill with our words. We assassinate our spouse’s character and then put blame on our spouse for our  bad behavior. We call it justified anger, rather than take ownership of our actions. <br> <br>
              So, here are some <b>CHOICES </b> that you may want to  consider in this new year. <br>
              <b>1. CHOOSE </b> to be Thankful daily.  Thank the Lord for your spouse and children. Don’t practice bitterness, sourness or hurtfulness but rather sing a new song, “Count your blessing name them one by one”…… <br> <br>
              Develop a merry heart and smile at little things that want to steal your peace and joy.
              "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus".					Philippians 4:6-7
              A heart full of gratitude produces abundance of Joy. <br> <br>

             <b> 2.	CHOOSE</b> to lose Anger.
             ‘Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools".
                                  Ecc 7:9

              Does an angry person make a good spouse? 

              <b>THINK!</b> <br>

              Most of the time, anger is not wisdom. Anger can be good if it is used at the right time, is controlled, is directed toward the right ends, and is not simply an expression of personal, willful frustration because things are not going as expected. When angered we are not concerned about our spouse’s welfare, but rather it’s about how we feel. Make a choice to lose anger that does not benefit the spirit. <br> <br>

            <b>  3.	CHOOSE</b> to Love unconditionally. <br>
                "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6.Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  1 Cor 13:4-7 <br>
              Love is not easily angered. 
              This year choose to love intentionally. Love will overcome hate. Make it a habit to show love to your spouse daily rather than complain. Show love always and not only when you are happy with your spouse. Tell your spouse how blessed you are to be married to a wonderful person. What you failed to feed will die. Your marriage is a living being and must be fed daily with the right nutrients to survive. <br><br>

            <b>4.	CHOOSE Peace.</b> <br>
              
            “Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.”        Col 3:15

              Though happy couples argue, let the peace of God reign in your homes. Let your focus be on your spouse’s strength and not weaknesses. 
              <br>
              <b>Learn to celebrate small, good moments!</b> <br>
              
              When we both choose to lose in a fight, we both win.
              There is a price for peace but the price for war is costly. Choose Peace. <br> <br>

             <b> 5.	CHOOSE to sow the right seed.</b> <br>

              “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 8 Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.” 					Gal 6:7-10. <br> <br>
              Sowing and reaping is God’s principle. If we sow negative seeds, we will reap negative fruit. If we sow positive seeds; we will reap positive fruit. <br>
              Every spouse wants a positive harvest in their marriage, but typically respond in ways that are counter productive. A wife wants her husband to spend time with her, but she criticizes him. Her desires is opposite of the seed she is sowing. The seed of criticism will only produce a negative fruit in her husband. Likewise, a husband that decided to give his wife a cold shoulder or stonewall her, thinking that if I ignore her she will get it, is sowing seed contrary to the outcome he desires.
              We must do the opposite of what our nature desires in order to have the right harvest. Sometimes it may take days,  weeks, months or years to get the desired harvest, do not lose hope , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest. <br>
              <br>
              So, <b>CHOOSE</b> the good seed to plant in your marriage and home. <br>
                Good seed of Kindness. <br>
                Good seed of a listening ear <br>
                Good seed of affirmation. <br>
                Good seed of service. <br>
                Good seed of forgiveness. <br>
                <b>MAKE THE GOOD SEED YOUR CHOICE. </b> <br>
                Finally, 
                You can pray, fast, seek HIS  face but the CHOICE will still have to be made. Personal responsibility is not a substitute for prayer. Making right choices is a personal responsibility. <br>
                Prayer works but there is still the place of personal responsibility.  <br> <br>
                <b>THE CHOICE IS YOURS!</b> <br>

                I pray that the Lord will grant us grace to understand and enlarge HIS words in our hearts.  <br>
                Thanks and be blessed.  <br>
