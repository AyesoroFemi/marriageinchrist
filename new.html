            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">

              As women we wear many hats. We are wife, mother, grandmother, sister, friend, daughter, niece, girlfriend, counselor, career woman, pastor’s wife, student, coach, homemaker, teacher, church worker, leader, mentor, nurse, prayer warrior, miracle worker ,and the list goes on and on, and quite interestingly we are gifted in a way that we wear some of those hats at the same time. A woman can be cooking and at the same time doing laundry, having the dishwasher loaded, cleaning the house, at the same time talking on the phone with a friend, child, or husband helping to solve a problem. <br>
              We are usually the first ones to get up in the morning and the very last ones to go to bed at night. <br>
              Spiritually and emotionally we carry the burden of the family, extended family, and friends, and so our prayer list is always long. We tend to spend more time on our knees praying. <br>
              How do we get strength to do all of these tasks?
              I know the Bible says we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.
               Honestly, as humans sometimes we do get overwhelmed by the many hats that we wear.
              One thing we always fail to realize for the most part is that we are called to love others as we love ourselves.  <br>

              The point here is that most of the time when we wear these hats we tend to forget ourselves, because we tend to put others first. It's just natural with us women to be caring and we tend to always take care of others first. I can relate with that and I know many of us can relate with this as well.  <br>
              I will be cooking so many dishes for the family amongst doing other things and find out at the end I have nothing to eat, as I have my diet/nutritional restrictions that I follow. By this time, I will be already exhausted and sometimes have to resort to whatever is easy to eat that may not be as nutritional for me. Whatever family activities that follow, I will not be able to participate effectively. <br> <br>
              A story was told of a woman and her child travelling on the plane and at a point there was an emergency that needed them to wear their oxygen masks.  As we can predict, the woman started fixing her child's mask first, and was struggling so hard to achieve this, then she heard the announcement again, “fix yourself first”, so she fixed herself first then it was easy for her to quickly fix her child, and both of them were safe till they landed. <br> <br>

              This last summer, I was overwhelmed with so many engagements, one engagement after the other. At one point I realized I was in 5 different states within 2 weeks and I felt like burnt out. It was then impressed in me to fix myself first before proceeding with further engagements. Then I started taking short breaks by requesting for 1 to 2 days off at work, along with the weekends just to relax, improve my nutrition and rest. I started to feel better. It made it easier for me to take care of my family, able to respond better to my family/people rather than reacting. I was able to become a better me, and a better witness for Christ. <br>
              
              When the vision of the Marriage in Christ ministry started over 3 years ago as a women's ministry, some found it strange that we had a marriage ministry that started as a women's ministry, but as many as are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. <br>
              Recently, I found out that some professional marriage therapists are advocating for how a woman only can change her marriage, that was another confirmation to me that if the worldly system can believe that a woman only can be empowered to change her marriage, how much more a godly woman empowered by the holy Spirit and the word of God.  <br>
              To the glory of God we have recorded testimonies of change of stories for good with the women's ministry.
              
              While we have no originating power in ourselves to change anyone, it's the job of the Holy Spirit. The Bible only encourages us in 1 Peter 3:1, “Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives.” <br>
               
              So, the power to change your spouse is rooted in fixing yourself first. <br>
              
              Why should you embrace the idea of fixing yourself first?(as a man or woman). <br>
              With awareness comes freedom and when you see just how much power that results in personal change, you will be interested in order to get the kind of life you desire.
              
              When you become a healthier person every other relationship you are in will change. <br>
              
              You will see one of two things happen. Your partner will be affected by your change which is the best chance they will change.
              
              What do you need to embark on this journey of fixing yourself first? <br>
              
              A willing heart, that is willing to take full responsibility in that relationship. What you will need to be always conscious of, is that we are stewards in our relationships, as stewards we are going to give accounts of what we did or doing, and as with any assignment given by God , there are rewards attached to our successful consummation of these assignments. <br> <br>
              
              2 Chronicles 16:9
              "For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong on the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him".
              
              When GOD sees that your heart is set right, he will align you to be exposed to all that you need for your fix, that will bring your desired change in your spouses, children, family, friend and the whole world will be affected by this change.
              
              Deal with pride. The Bible says God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. When we deal with pride in our hearts, it helps the grace of God to make it easy for us to relate well with everyone around us. <br>
              
              Proverbs 13:10
              "Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.”
              
              Be intentional in creating a "ME" time, this will help to be more effective in our management of our various tasks, so that we do not develop chronic illnesses in the process of doing them.
              
              I want to encourage us to go in this our might into the new year of fixing yourself first to be empowered to fix others, and become better in being a world changer.
              
              Merry Christmas season ❤ <br>
              Shalom. <br>
