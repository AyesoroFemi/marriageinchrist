              IMPROVING ROMANCE IN MARRIAGE.
            </p>
            <p class="px-2 fs-6">
              Romance is the feeling of having one’s most important relationship needs met by another person, and wanting to meet his or her needs in return.  It’s a powerful force that makes you feel connected to someone in a deeper way. Displays of affection are a very crucial need in the majority of relationships. <br>
For some, exhibiting romance does not come naturally, possibly due to our personalities or the environment we grew up in. <br> <br>
Romantic love may mean different things to different people. For some of us of the older generation from African descent ,the word "romance" is not something common, due to our culture in which women are not seen to be as valued as men; some take it to a higher level and see the woman as a property that they can treat with less respect and dignity. <br> <br> For some it could be as a result of the high bride price or the way they saw their fathers or other family members treated their wives. The Bible made us know that when we are in Christ, we have become a new creature, old things have passed away, all things have become new (2 Cor. 5:17). We know with the new creation of our Spirit that when we give our lives to Christ, our soul needs to be renewed with the word of God. <br> <br>
The word romance when mentioned, some Christians tend to attach it to a worldly virtue due to lack of understanding; the bible contains a lot of information on love and romance as recorded in Songs of Solomon and 1 Corinthians 13. <br>
As the definition of romance stated above, it's all about meeting each other's needs in a deeper way. It takes selflessness and walking in the love of God, as stated in 1 Corinthians 13, to be able to have romance operate effectively in our marriage. <br> 
It's important that you and your partner be on the same page; talk to each other about your needs and offer suggestions about how you would like these needs to be met. Shared intimacy and passion can often lead to a strong, shared commitment to each other and to a lasting blissful relationship. <br> <br>

<b>Practical Ways to Demonstrate Romance in a Marital Relationship.
</b> <br>
<b>1. Give them your full attention.</b> <br>

Listen attentively when your partner is talking. This shows them you are genuinely concerned with what they are saying. Avoid multitasking to allow for full concentration; this goes a long way to prove your love in action. The Bible says we should love not only in words but in deed (1John 3:18). You could let them know you are listening actively by repeating what they say after them at times during the conversation. <br>

<b>2. Validate their feelings 
</b> <br>
Tell them the emotion you perceive from their conversation and let them know you can see that, and be not judgemental about their feelings.  Try and find ways to connect with that emotion to help them feel better about the situation. <br>


<b>3. Be alert and sensitive to their needs. </b> <br>
Try and think of how you can meet their needs ahead of time. A partner that has gone to work all day or night,  and you are at home or less busy deserves to be treated with tenderness. This could look like having food ready before getting home or getting the laundry done.This requires understanding the needs and values of your partner at different times. <br>

<b>4. Know their love language.
</b> <br>
Do they like words of affirmation, physical touch, spending quality time, gifts, or acts of service? Get to know what their love languages are, and learn how to love them this way to build a strong relationship. <br>

<b>5. Touch them. 
</b> <br>
One of the easiest way to do this is by holding hands to pray together daily. When one is going out, or coming in, make it a habit to hug the other person. Go on a love walk holding hands, and your conversation might likely be more positive. <br>

<b>6. Always make time.
</b> <br>
No matter how busy you are, let your partner know they are your priority. Always make time for them. Pick up their phones when it's not even convenient. Go out of your way to do things they enjoy. Set a weekly date night that each one of you can take turns to plan activities to do. Stay in a room together alone, even when nothing or no conversation is going on. <br>

<b>7. Make eye contact.
</b> <br>
Having eye to eye contacts speaks volume in the relationship. It shows some level of agreement, and affection that can keep reigniting your attraction for each other similar to the times when you first started dating. <br>

<b>8. Verbalize and communicate that you love them,  and why you love them. 
</b> <br>
Going  a step further to say what we love about them goes a long way to prove your love <br>

<b>9. Be their biggest cheerleader. 
</b> <br>
Make every effort to be their biggest fan and supporter both openly in front of the children, friends, and family, as well as in private too. If they engage in an activity or competition, try to be the first to compliment them before anyone does. <br>

<b>10. Ask them what you can do to make them happier. 
</b> <br>
Find out what will make them happier, and strive to do your best to do it.Most of the time we assume that what we like and desire is the same thing our partner desires. Finding out what your partner desires helps you to be precise and it helps you to get the response you are expecting to get. <br>

<b>11.  Provoke one another to love and to good works (Heb. 10:24) 
</b> <br>
Accept what your partner has to offer and make sure you look for ways to reciprocate back. Do not criticise their efforts by responding in a derogatory way to what they give you or the help they offer. Be thankful always for every act of kindness, no matter how little it may seem. <br>

Romance as earlier mentioned is not necessarily something common of the older generation, especially people of African descent. However, within the younger generation not only is it more common, many young people look forward to it. The best romance is based on the principles of the Word of God, as it is never ending. <br>
Shalom! <br>
