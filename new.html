                Genesis chapter 2 verse 18. 
                And the Lord God said, “I will make him a helper capable to you.” Now are you aware that when God  created everything in Genesis chapter 1, everything was good? Everything He created was good. And  now He made man, Adam in His own image. <br>
                 And I’m sure this is something mature Christians will even  find difficult in understanding. Because the triune head is complete: God the Father, God the Son and  God the Spirit. They are complete. They don’t need any support. They don’t feel lonely. They don’t feel  alone. They’re just complete. <br>
                 And when He made man, Adam, He made man triune. So man was made  in the image of God, body soul and spirit.  
                And thereafter a while, after God had had fellowship and interaction with Adam over a period of time,  this same God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent came to the conclusion that it is not  good for man, as in the masculine gender, to be alone. It’s not good. So what does that tell us? That tells  us that even though man was made in the image of God, and even though man was having fellowship  with God, and even though Adam did not even know there was something inadequate in his life, God  knew that this man is incomplete. God knew that if he leaves this man alone, a point may come in time  when this man will destroy himself. <br> God knew that if he leaves this man alone a time will come when  this man will not be able to make good decisions.  <br>
                Adam had the mind of God. He had named all the animals, yet god said that this man is alone. Adam did  not even know the need in his life. Yet God made a woman and brought her to Adam. Now, it’s  remarkable that the first time Adam saw a woman, he saw a wife. And that’s why in Genesis 2, God says  “for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife.” For the first time a  man, masculine, saw a woman, female, he saw a wife. He did not see a single lady. He did not see a  single girl. Now we have to go through scriptures to realize that there’s not much emphasis on single  women. The emphasis of the bible on single women describes them as daughters, or talks about them  as virgins. So the assumption from the beginning was that the concept of a woman, the concept for the  creation of the woman was for the woman to be a wife. And what kind of wife? A helper to man. To  assist a man. To complete a man. <br>
                You know people say, “ok the woman does not complete the man and all” when he does not understand  the value of a woman. He does not understand the value of a wife. So if God made the woman to be a  helper to the man, why do we have situations where the women are not helping? Why do we have  situations where the woman does not make an attempt to help the man? In my opinion, it is primarily  because the woman is not aware of her role and her purpose. We have come to see the wife as some  kind of trophy or asset in the house or as just a mother of children. We have come to see the wife as just  a supporting personality behind a man. <br>
                What has been the concept  of scriptures to articulate the way woman was created, the woman was to help the man.  <br>
                Number 1, God said it is not good for the man to be alone. So the woman I’m going to give him will help  him. And you and I know that if I’m carrying suitcase that is say 50 pounds, a child cannot help carry it 
                because the child is too small. So the person who is going to help you carry it has to be somebody with  the capacity to carry the 50-pound suitcase. Or someone stronger or heavier than the 50-pound  suitcase. So what does that tell us? It means that when God created the woman and said I want you to  help the man, God was willing to put elements, God was going to put material, wisdom, intellectual  capacity and fortitude and revelation and insight into a woman. One that will not just be comparable to  the man but also be superior to the man.  <br>
                Because we have all these issues of men struggling and feeling they’re in competition with their wives.  When they see their wives trying to excel some of them get angry, become hostile and some even begin  to use witchcraft and manipulation. Such behaviour is born out of ignorance because the woman was  made to help you. And the wife cannot help a man if she is inferior to the man. Now the bible says the  women are the weaker vessels. They are only weaker in terms of anatomical structure or, you know,  composition and all that. But in terms of the functionality that they bring to a relationship, the woman  was made to be a helper.  <br>
                Fast forward to the new testament, John chapter 15 where Jesus said I will send you a comforter, the  parakletos. The comforter was going to be someone who has enough in himself to comfort. It was going  to be someone who had certain elements in her, in other words, to comfort you. It even goes on to say  He will lead you into all truth. Now how is a wife able to help her husband? How is she able to help her  husband? Brethren I’m going to tell you this. Let me tell you this, and these are things that I’ve not been  able to preach over time even in my own local church because of because of fear that some will sort of  doubt. Some men will think that oh, I’m putting too much pressure on the women. They will think I  don’t value the women. No it’s because it is in the context of scriptures from understanding. <br>
                Yes, the man is the head of the home. Yes, the head carries the brain. But God has so created the home  such that the woman carries the heart. The man carries the brain yet the woman carries the heart. If you  keep the heart of a man out of the man, the man might survive for a while, but will eventually slump  and pass out, right? I know that when the brain dies, the individual dies. But God has so wired a woman  such that the woman has great capacity.  <br>
                Now look at Proverbs 31. Look at how it starts. “Who can find a virtuous wife?” As earlier mentioned, when God created a woman the concept was and the paramount objective was to create her as a wife. So the primary object of God creating a woman was to create her as a wife. So, the mother of King  Lemuel (Solomon) was writing to him and said “who can find a virtuous wife.”  <br>
                Let me back up a little. In Proverbs 31 look at verse 3. It said “do not give your strength to women.” She was telling Solomon, “nor your ways to those who destroy kings.” Brethren, kings or monarchs in those  days were all powerful. They were the ones who literally had the power of life and death in their hands.  <br>
                They could take out a man’s life, snuff out a man and all of that. But it implies a woman can destroy a  king. It takes a more powerful person to destroy a king. That’s the power of a woman.  <br>
                Now let’s go on Proverbs 31 verse 10. It says “who can find a virtuous wife, for her worth is far above  rubies.” If you go on and continue to read, verse 11 says “the heart of her husband safely trusts her so  he will have no lack of gain.” “She does him good and not evil all the days of her life.” And she goes on  and on.  <br>
                Look at what it says in verse 23. It says “her husband is known in the gates where he sits among the  elders of the land.” So essentially, because of the fact that our society is wired such that the man is  superior or higher in that context of ranking. You know, he is the head of the family and all that. It’s  possible men would have been called Mr. This (after the woman) just as the woman is usually called Mrs 
                this after him. Perhaps men would have been called Mrs this. Because you see her husband is known in  the gates. Essentially it is the leverage of the woman he is enjoying. The authority of the woman, the  performance of the woman, the wisdom of the woman, the great capacity, the interpersonal skills, even  the business acumen of the woman. It is the habits, the business relationships of the woman that makes  people, when they see the man at the gate, to say “oh, do you know this woman, ok that’s the  husband.” And that’s what John Kennedy did the day he died when he went to Dallas. When he went to  Dallas and he came off the plane and he wanted to address the crowd, he said “I’m the one who  followed Mrs Kennedy to Dallas.”  <br>
                Now brethren why have I laid all this foundation? Because if you go back and look at Proverbs 31, you  understand because you look at all that the woman can do. She’s the one that organizes business  relationships, she’s the one that provides this, she’s the one that does this. Ok, I’m not saying the man  does not have any responsibility. Because as the head, the job of the man is to guide. The man is  supposed to support. The man is supposed to inspire. The man is supposed to affirm. The man is  supposed to protect. The man is supposed to provide, as much as he has the capability.  <br>
                But, this is the kicker and I want you to hear this, I have shared all of this to help you to see that when  the woman is competent enough to exhibit some of these traits, because not all women can. We know  some men spend more than their wives. Some men are way ahead of their wives. But there are some  women who have been particularly gifted. And some of them are able to exhibit some of these traits.  The man should not feel intimidated. The man should not feel cowered. The man should not become  bitter. The man should not become hostile and acrimonious towards his wife. He should not. Because  that is actually the biblical guideline for the role of the woman in a man’s life.  <br>
                It turns out that in our society today, men earn more than women. men are more likely to get a job  compared to a woman. In America as we saw from the case of Hillary Clinton, I came to realize that America is not ready for a woman president. Because the things that men will take from a man, they will  not take it from a woman. So they judge women. Even when Pamela Harris was trying to run for vice  president, some of the insinuations and comments they were making in the newspaper were terrible.  The thing is that, women have a measure of vulnerability or some kind of disadvantage in the society.  <br>
                But I want to say this to my brothers and sisters. If you know that you as a woman that God has gifted  you, you should not shy away from your responsibilities. Except that you must be wise. You must be  wise in order to navigate your husband’s ego, because men have fragile egos. You must be wise to know  how to massage his ego and surge his ego. You know, tell him whatever you think you need to tell him in  order to be sure that you as the neck of the family you can turn the head with the power of God in whatever direction  you want it to go.  <br>
                And for you the man, if you know that your wife has this gifting, your wife is a Margaret Thatcher. Your  wife is an Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. Your wife is a Hillary Clinton. In fact, if you study  the life of Hillary and her husband, Hillary said the day she met Bill Clinton and it became obvious that  she was going to marry him. She said she decided that “I was going to make this man president.” So you  can imagine how much that man listened to Hillary.  <br>
                So, if your wife is that kind of person, brother, you should be thankful to God, because God gave you an  immeasurable priceless gift. Guess what, if you have her and allow her to fly, you’ll be known in the  gates. Your honour will be double. The glory of God upon your life will never diminish. And not because  you allowed your wife to occupy centre stage and you allow her to soar. But rather because you  submitted to biblical guidelines on how to shepherd a family, shepherd a home and mentor your wife in  order to bring glory and honour to the family. 
                Now when you do this and when you keep the home intact, trust me, you will be on the side of God.  Where we know that this battle to win the family, to keep the society and to advance as many people  into the kingdom of God as possible, you will be on the side of God. And by God he will give you praise.  By God he will give you resources. By God he will protect you. By God he will empower you.  
                I pray for you today brethren and I hope that what I have shared had been a blessing. And all of us  would work in the kingdom of God and would make our Father proud.  
                God bless you.
