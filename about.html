                        Marriage in Christ ministry for women is a group of Christian Women from all nationalities, ethnicity from all over the world. The ministry was inaugurated in June 2018. The vision of the ministry is to seek and gain more understanding of the marital relationship; in order to equip women with all the necessary tools needed to be the helper God has called us to be to our husbands as stated in Genesis 2:18 that:
                         "The Lord God said it is not good for a man to be alone, I will make for him a suitable HELPER". 
                        Hence, the need for us to get all that we need to do this job effectively and productively.
                         <br> <br>
                        We do this by engaging in monthly corporate prayers and ministrations, encouraging ourselves on our WhatsApp chat group daily, individual prayers, biblical exhortations, professional referral as needed, organized annual Couple's event as an outreach program to married couples in our community and beyond, etc. 
                        <br><br>
                        The institution of marriage is not a casual one. The issue of marriage, of the family, and of home life is one of the most fundamental and basic institution in society. 
                        The church (in its formal sense) was not yet founded, when God established the family as an institution. The state as a formal institution was not yet in existence when the family was brought into being. The family is foundational; it was first, because it is basic. And it is just, because it is first in Scripture, that we must make every effort to preserve the family. The guns are pointed at the very existence of the family itself, and we will be in serious trouble if we do not defend it from the attack. It is crucial to such a defense for Christians once again to understand and to reaffirm the basic Biblical principles concerning the family.
                        This is because the marriage institution, which is an offshoot of the family system, is supposed to be a life of utopia on earth, and a sort of Paradise here on earth. But today the marriage institution is under a siege, all over the world. On a sad note, it should be noted that available statistics on marriage today painted the picture of precarious marital failures all over the world.
                        The most important purpose of marriage is that of oneness, revealed in Ephesians 5 31- 32. As the scripture says, a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one. This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one.
